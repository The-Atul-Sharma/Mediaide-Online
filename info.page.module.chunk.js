Cosmetic Surgery can make changes on the functioning parts of your body in order to make that part to look better. Cosmetic\n        surgery is a form of Plastic surgery. Plastic Surgery is a broader field of surgery primarily concerned with moulding or moving tissues for healing, improving function or to correct the congenital defects or those acquired later by trauma or surgery.\n        Cosmetic surgery can be performed on all areas of the head, neck and body. Because treated areas function properly but lack aesthetic appeal, cosmetic surgery is elective. Cosmetic surgery is one of the fast evolving branches of medicine with\n        newer methods, technique and technology coming into this field.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"font15\">\n        Many people travel around the world in search of affordable and high quality cosmetic surgery.

Some of the centres even have board certified cosmetic\n        surgeons who have a vast experience in this field. The plastic surgeons have the expertise in doing complex micro vascular surgery or reconstructive microsurgery where the surgeries are done using an operating microscope to cut and join tiny blood\n        vessels and nerves, most between half a millimetre and 2 millimetres in size. Our network centres are equipped with cutting edge microsurgical equipment.
