        Cosmetic Surgery or Aesthetic surgery helps to modify or improve the appearance of a physical feature, irregularity, or defect. Cosmetic Surgery can make changes on the functioning parts of your body in order to make that part to look better. Cosmetic
        surgery is a form of Plastic surgery. Plastic Surgery is a broader field of surgery primarily concerned with moulding or moving tissues for healing, improving function or to correct the congenital defects or those acquired later by trauma or surgery.
        Cosmetic surgery can be performed on all areas of the head, neck and body. Because treated areas function properly but lack aesthetic appeal, cosmetic surgery is elective. Cosmetic surgery is one of the fast evolving branches of medicine with
        newer methods, technique and technology coming into this field.
