        Orthopaedic surgeries and treatments are concerned with the musculoskeletal system. The orthopaedic surgeons use both, surgical and non-surgical means to treat sports injuries, degenerative diseases, tumors, and musculoskeletal trauma.

    <p class="font15">
        Numerous surgeries like knee arthroscopy and chondroplasty, removal of support implant, knee arthroscopy and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, knee replacement, shoulder replacement, repair of rotator tuff tendons, are performed by a set of highly
        trained and experienced doctors under a technologically advanced infrastructure and latest equipments and precision tools.

        Different reasons like, the quality of treatment done here, scope of different treatments, price of the medical procedure are just tip of the iceberg. India has advanced both medically and technologically when it comes to treating patients.

            Quite a large number of orthopaedic surgeons have made a mark over the globe with their skilful hands and their specialisation in different bones of the body. With the latest technology, treatments such as invasive surgery, bone and cartlage transplants
            and spine surgery. Different kinds of muscoskeletal problems like arthiritis to bone tumors, from sports injuries to childhood conditions, are performed on a regular basis and the success rate is increasing day by day.

            Total cost of the surgery is one of the biggest reasons as to why people from across the world are choosing India to get their treatment done. A knee joint replacement costs about $6,500 to $13,000 in India. In the UK a similar surgery using the same
            implants and medical consumables costs around $15,000, in USA – $45,000, in Thailand and Costa Rica – $15,000, in Singapore – $20,000.

            Time also plays a crucial role in picking the destination for your medical procedures. While the waiting time in countries like US, Canada or UK is approximately 6-8 months, Indian hospitals provide you with bare minimum waiting time and patients can
            actually get their treatment done within a week’s time if they prefer to.

        The Medical Council for Tourism and the orthopaedic Surgeons India, are set to collaborate, with a sole aim to make the sub-continent the most preferred destination for medical needs.
