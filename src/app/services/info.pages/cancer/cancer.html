        Cancer surgery is the removal of the tumor and surrounding tissue during an operation. A doctor who specializes in treating cancer using surgery is called a surgical oncologist.
    </p>
    <p class="font15">
        The goals of surgery may vary from patient to patient. However, mostly it is used to remove or diagnose cancer causing cells. It may also be done to find out where the cancer is located or if it has spread or affected the function of any other organs
        in the body. The cancer surgery restores the body appearance or function.

        <span class="bold">Pocket friendly pricing: </span>The cost of getting cancer treatment in India is very low compared with other medical tourism countries. It is nearly 10 to 20% of what is charged in the US or the UK.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="font15">
        <span class="bold">Lesser waiting time for surgeries: </span> Most medical tourists come to India after learning that they would have to wait for months for undergoing cancer treatment in their native country. So instead of waiting for a long
        time and suffer in the meanwhile, flying to India for treatment is a much better option.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="font15">
        <span class="bold">Fluent English speaking staff: </span>The Indian medical industry has high professionalism and all the doctors, nurses and most of the paramedical staff are fluent in English. So you need not have to worry about not being misunderstood
        and this will eliminate the need for a translator.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="font15">
        <span class="bold">Technology is at par with the hospitals in abroad: </span>India is known for medical treatments wherein advanced health care is required, such as in case of cancer treatments. The Indian hospitals are equipped with high end
        technologies such as Cyber knife, Gamma knife, etc.
