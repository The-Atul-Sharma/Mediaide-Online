            care.

            to prepare beforehand. Your doctor may revise some of their instructions after your surgery, based on how your surgery went and how well you’re recovering. Post operative care depends specifically on the type of operation you’ve undergone.
            There are numerous ways in which your post treatment care could be taken for. In India, in addition to existence of modern medicine, indigenous or traditional medical practitioners continue to practice throughout the country. Popular indigenous
            healthcare traditions include Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Naturopathy, and Yoga.

            body and lead to illness. The cleansing process—called “panchakarma”— is designed to reduce your symptoms and restore harmony and balance.
